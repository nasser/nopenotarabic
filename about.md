# Nope, Not Arabic
Nope, Not Arabic is an archive of things that are not Arabic. It documents
instances of butchered Arabic script in public, from major motion pictures to
billboards to video games and everything in between.

# What is happening?
Computers are designed to handle the subset of the Latin script required to
manipulate American English first and foremost. Every other writing system is an
afterthought, and Arabic is particularly poorly served. Most of the images in
this archive are the result of non-Arab graphic designers pasting Arabic text
into graphic design software that cannot handle 

I have written about this at length at [The Increment](https://increment.com/programming-languages/unplain-text-primer-on-non-latin/) and the [Decolonising the Digital Journal](http://ojs.decolonising.digital/index.php/decolonising_digital/article/view/PersonalComputer).

# What do I do if I see butchered Arabic?
Contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ra) or [email](mailto:ram@nas.sr)
with a screenshot or photograph and information on where and when you saw it and
I will be happy to add it to the archive. You should also contact the people 
responsible, if possible, and tell them they are embarrassing themselves and
offending a billion people.

# How do I avoid butchering Arabic?
My article at [The Increment](https://increment.com/programming-languages/unplain-text-primer-on-non-latin/)
gets into it.

# Who's behind this?
Hi, I'm [Ramsey Nasser](http://nas.sr/) and I do research into the hidden
cultural assumptions present in computing among other things. Arabic is my
native language so I lose sleep over this shit.

This archive was originally [on tumblr](https://nopenotarabic.tumblr.com) but as
that platform has degraded over the years I decided to move everything to a git
repo where I have more control over the content.
